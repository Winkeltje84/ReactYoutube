# React Youtube site

This is a repo for tracking my steps in the Modern React with Redux Udemy course by Stephen Grider. It makes use of the Youtube API & updates 5 search results when input in the search bar is changed. When clicking on one of the 5 search results that video will be shown in an embedded field where it can be played.

## Current state
So far I have just followed the course, really helped a lot and I am starting to understand more and more React. It is really getting interesting. The course will go on into Redux at this time of writing, but I quite probably will come back to this repo lateron to do some twitching...
